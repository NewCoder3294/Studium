  <h1>Study Techniques</h1>

  <div class="technique">
    <h2>1. Active Recall</h2>
    <p>Involves regularly testing yourself on material you're learning, even before you feel fully prepared. This technique goes beyond simple memorization by requiring active engagement with the material and simulating actual test conditions. Creating and taking practice tests helps identify knowledge gaps, reduces test anxiety through familiarity with the testing process, and strengthens memory through the testing effect - the phenomenon where the act of retrieving information enhances long-term retention. This can include using flashcards, sample questions, past exams, or creating your own quiz questions.</p>

    <h2>2. Pomodoro Technique</h2>
    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses focused work sessions followed by short breaks to maintain high productivity and prevent mental fatigue. Each 25-minute work period (called a "Pomodoro") is followed by a 5-minute break, with a longer 15-30 minute break after completing four Pomodoros. This technique works by leveraging the brain's attention span patterns and providing regular recovery periods. It helps prevent burnout, maintains consistent energy levels, and makes large tasks more manageable by breaking them into smaller, focused sessions. The technique also helps track productivity and reduces the impact of internal and external interruptions.</p>

    <h2>3. Feynman Technique</h2>
    <p>Named after physicist Richard Feynman, this technique involves explaining complex concepts in simple terms, as if teaching them to someone with no background in the subject. The process has four key steps: choose a concept, teach it to a beginner (real or imaginary), identify gaps in your explanation, and then review and simplify further. This method is powerful because it forces you to understand something deeply enough to explain it simply, helps identify areas where your understanding is weak, and strengthens your ability to communicate complex ideas. If you can't explain something simply, you haven't truly understood it.</p>

    <h2>4. Mind Mapping</h2>
    <p>Mind mapping is a visual thinking tool that creates a graphical representation of ideas and concepts. Starting with a central concept, related ideas branch out in a radial pattern, creating an organized, hierarchical structure. This technique leverages the brain's natural tendency to think in networks and associations rather than linear sequences. Colors, images, and connecting lines help create meaningful relationships between ideas, making it easier to remember and understand complex topics. Mind maps are particularly effective for brainstorming, note-taking, and organizing large amounts of information into a comprehensible format.</p>

    <h2>5. SQ3R Method</h2>
    <p>The SQ3R method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review) is a comprehensive reading and studying strategy that enhances comprehension and retention of written material. First, you Survey the material by scanning headers, summaries, and key points to get an overview. Then, you form Questions about the material, creating learning objectives. Next, you actively Read the material while seeking answers to your questions. After reading, you Recite the main points in your own words without referring to the text. Finally, you Review the material to ensure understanding and retention. This systematic approach transforms passive reading into an active learning experience.</p>

    <h2>6. Dual Coding</h2>
    <p>Dual coding is a learning strategy based on the principle that combining verbal and visual information enhances memory and understanding. When you process information through both verbal and visual channels, you create multiple pathways to remember and recall that information. This could involve creating diagrams alongside written notes, using infographics, or drawing simple illustrations to represent concepts. The technique is particularly effective because it engages different parts of the brain simultaneously, creating stronger neural connections and making the information more memorable and easier to recall.</p>

    <h2>7. Chunking</h2>
    <p>Chunking is a powerful learning technique that involves breaking down complex information into smaller, more manageable pieces or "chunks." This approach works by accommodating the limitations of working memory, which can typically hold only about 4-7 items at once. For example, rather than trying to memorize a long string of numbers, you might break it into smaller groups. In learning complex subjects, you might break down a large topic into subtopics, master each separately, then understand how they connect. This technique makes learning more manageable, reduces cognitive load, and helps create meaningful patterns in information.</p>
